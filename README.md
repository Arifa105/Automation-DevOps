# Azure DevOps Terraform Pipeline
This Azure DevOps pipeline automates the deployment of infrastructure using Terraform on Azure. It performs the following tasks:

Install Terraform: Installs the latest version of Terraform.

Initialize Terraform: Initializes the Terraform configuration and sets up the backend for storing the state file.

Validate Terraform Configuration: Validates the Terraform configuration for syntax errors.

Plan Deployment: Generates an execution plan for Terraform, showing what changes will be made to the infrastructure.

Apply Deployment: Applies the Terraform plan to provision or update Azure resources.

Archive Files: Archives the source files into a ZIP file for deployment or distribution.

Publish Artifacts: Publishes the build artifacts to the specified container for further use.

# Azure DevOps Multi-Repository Terraform Pipeline
This Azure DevOps pipeline automates the deployment of Azure infrastructure using Terraform from multiple Git repositories. It performs the following tasks for two Terraform repositories (terraform1 and terraform2):

Checkout Repositories: Checks out the source code from the terraform1 and terraform2 repositories.

Install Terraform: Installs the latest version of Terraform for both repositories.

Initialize Terraform: Initializes the Terraform configuration for each repository and sets up the backend for state file storage in Azure.

Validate Terraform Configuration: Validates the syntax and configuration of the Terraform files in both repositories.

Plan Terraform Deployment: Generates a Terraform execution plan for both repositories based on the defined variables (e.g., location, resource group, virtual network).

Apply Terraform Deployment: Applies the Terraform plan and provisions or updates the Azure resources for each repository.

Publish Artifacts: (Optional) Collects build artifacts and publishes them for use in subsequent pipelines or deployments.
